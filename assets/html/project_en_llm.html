<h5>Research Roadmap & Academic Book Recommendation System (In Progress)</h5> 
<p> 
  This project aims to develop an intelligent system that recommends 
  personalized research roadmaps and relevant academic books for graduate 
  students. The recommendation system is based on a hybrid filtering approach 
  that integrates students' academic and research data with an external book 
  database. A sLLM with fewer than 8 billion parameters is planned to be used 
  for model training and inference. Additionally, the system leverages a 
  graph-based structure using Neo4j to enable relationship-based exploration 
  and reasoning.

<ul> 
  <li><strong>Model:</strong> To be determined (sLLM under 8B parameters planned)</li> 
  <li><strong>Database:</strong> Neo4j-based Graph DB</li> 
  <li><strong>Role:</strong> Project planning, database modeling and construction, system architecture design, model training</li> 
  <li><strong>Current Status:</strong> Graph DB (Neo4j) construction completed; recommendation logic design and data collection in progress</li>
